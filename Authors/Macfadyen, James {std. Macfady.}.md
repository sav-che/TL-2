### Publications

##### n.5170. The flora of Jamaica

**Title**
*The flora of Jamaica*; a description of the plants of that island, arranged according to the natural orders. With an appendix, containing an enumeration of the genera according to the Linnaean system, and an essay on the geographical distribution of the species... London (Longman, Orme, Brown, Green & Longmans), Edinburgh (Adam & Charles Block), Glasgow (Sohn Smith & son) 1837, 1 vol. Oct. †.
**Abbreviated title**: *Fl. Jamaica*.

**Notes**
*1*: 10 Oct 1837-8 Nov 1837, p. \[i\*\], \[i\]-ix, \[x-xi, tables\], \[1, note\], \[1\]-351. *Copies*: G, L, NY, US(2), USDA; IDC 6048.
*2*: 1850?, p. \[1\]-216. *Copies*: BM(1-216), HH, K(1-192), MICH (p. 1-8), NY(1-144), HH and MO (xerox copies of BM). – The BM copy has a note by W. Carruthers: "The sheets of this second volume were printed in Jamaica. – The printing was stopped because of the sudden death of Dr. Macfadyen. – Only a few copies exist. – Dr. Macfadyen's son informed me that the sheets were used as waste paper by the executor of his father's will." Other copies of p. 1-216 are reported to be in Jamaica and in the possession of the Macfadyen family, and at least two of the known copies lack pages: the NY copy lacks pp. 49-56 and 65-72; the HH copy lacks pp. 91-92 and 95-96; HH also has a photocopy of the BM copy. We have seen no direct evidence that the copies cited by Fawcett & Rendle do indeed exist but it is not critical; for effective publication a minimum of two extant copies is needed: with this criterion p. 1-192 of vol. 2 could be accepted as effectively published. In TL-1 the conclusion of W. T. Stearn, that the second volume was not effectively published, was adopted, an opinion shared by G. R. Proctor and C. D. Adams currently studying the flora of Jamaica. At least half the binomials which would affect presently accepted ones are Melastomaceae; workers with this and other families would have to take names into consideration which are now treated as synonyms or ignored. Grisebach, Eichler, Urban and Britton cited names from the second volume, often as synonyms, but their treatment of them is equivocal and inconsistent.
If one can consider the "intent" of the author posthumously, it seems clear that neither he nor his heirs were prepared to distribute vol. 2 at the time of his death nor afterward. This, added to the conclusion of present-day students of the flora, as well as the nomenclatural stability to be gained by rejecting it, argues for considering the second volume ineffectively published. We leave the final decision to those whose research is affected by the existence of this incomplete work.
