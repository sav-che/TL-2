### Author

\* Buse, Lodewijk Hendrik (1819-1888), Dutch botanist and lawyer, born at Haarlem, collected in its surroundings with H.D. Gildemeester Buse, studied law at Utrecht (doctor of laws), moved to Renkum soon after 1845 (the year of the foundation of the Dutch Botanical Society of wich B. was a founder-member), issued *Musci neerlandici* (exsicc.) together with his wife Mrs. Buse-Koppiers, travelled in England and Germany, corresponded with Juratzka and Milde, active in the Dutch Botanical Society until 1865. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Buse*

#### Note

The correct spelling of the name of this Dutch botanist is Buse, however, in *Plantae junghuhnianae* (see below) he cites his name with the newly described species as "Büse" which led to some confusion as to what spelling should be used.
