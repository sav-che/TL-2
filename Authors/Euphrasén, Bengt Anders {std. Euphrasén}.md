### Author

Euphrasén, Bengt Anders (1756-1796), Swedish botanist who made a journey to the Swedish West Indies in 1788. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Euphrasén* \[standard form in IPNI: *Euphrasén*\]

#### Herbarium and types

The main Euphrasén herbarium was sold to Mellerborg (q.v.) and was acquired by Thunberg in 1806 and is now still incorporated in the Thunberg herbarium ([[Collection UPS|UPS]]). According to Urban the notes on localities were added later and do not always agree with Euphrasén's publications. The annotations on the sheets are by Thunberg, and it is highly probable that the latter received the plants unmounted and had them incorporated in his herbarium in the usual way, adding notes of his own. The collection does not seem to be complete. A small number of Euphrasén's plants is also at [[Collection S|S]].
