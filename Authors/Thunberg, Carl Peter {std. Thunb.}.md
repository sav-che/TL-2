**Abbreviated name**: *Thunb.*

#### Herbarium and types

[[Collection UPS|UPS]] (kept separate; available on IDC microfiche 1036; index IDC 5184). Thunberg gave his entire herbarium to Uppsala University in 1785. By that time it contained all the collections made during his travels as well as material received from some of his colleagues such as the Forsters. After 1785 Thunberg continued to insert material received by him in the "Thunberg herbarium" which was therefore for the rest of his lifetime the official herbarium of the University. The most important set of duplicates is now at [[Collection S|S]], through the herbaria of Alströmer and Montin. Other duplicates are at [[Collection B|B]] (extant; in the Willdenow herb.), [[Collection BM|BM]] (through Banks and from the sale of the Lambert herbarium who obtained his Thunberg set with the Pallas collection), [[Collection E|E]], [[Collection FI|FI]], [[Collection FR|FR]], [[Collection G|G]] (in the Delessert herbarium which incorporates the Burman herbarium, probably also a very important set), [[Collection GB|GB]], [[Collection GOET|GOET]], [[Collection H|H]], [[Collection JE|JE]], [[Collection KIEL|KIEL]], [[Collection L|L]], [[Collection LD|LD]] (through the Acharius and Retzius herbaria), [[Collection LE|LE]] (in the Ledebour herbarium), [[Collection LINN|LINN]] (Linnaeus received direct shipments of plants from the Cape), [[Collection LIV|LIV]], [[Collection M|M]], [[Collection MEL|MEL]] (in the Lehmann herbarium), [[Collection MPU|MPU]], [[Collection MW|MW]], [[Collection OXF|OXF]], [[Collection P|P]], [[Collection P|P]]-JU, [[Collection PH|PH]], [[Collection S|S]], [[Collection SBT|SBT]] (in the Bergius herbarium), [[Collection U|U]], [[Collection W|W]]. – Juel (1918) provides a list of all plants collected by Thunberg outside Sweden and of the plants described or cited in Thunberg's botanical publications with reference to the specimens in the Thunberg herbarium. – *Letters* received by Thunberg at Uppsala University Library, [[Collection A|A]]-HJO available on IDC microfiche 7646; letters to *Banks* at [[Collection BM|BM]], to J.E. Smith at [[Collection LINN|LINN]]; to C.H. Mertens at [[Collection HU|HU]], other letters at [[Collection G|G]]. A mss. *Flora capensis*, pre-1782, is at [[Collection BM|BM]].

- *Bartram, William* (1739-1823), (TL-2/1: 132-135), a few specimens labelled "Bartram" may have been collected either by John B. or by his son William. Thunberg may have obtained these specimens from J. Banks.

- *Burman, Nicolaas Laurens*, Sr. (1733-1793), ((TL-2/1:416-417). Some material from the Cape from "Burmann". This may stem from both N.L. Burman Sr. and Jr. Plants labelled "Ex herbario Burmann" may be of various origin (P. Hermann, Oldenland, Hartog, Tryon, Kleinhoff, Garcin; European correspondents of the Burmans) which is difficult to establish.
- *Burman, Nicolaas Laurens* Jr. (1782-1826), see above: some Cape material may stem from S. African plants grown in his garden at Loenen a.d. Vecht, Netherlands.
- *Cavanilles, Antoine José* (1745-1804), (TL-2/1: 471-474), specimens from the Madrid and Paris botanical gardens, and from his own collecting trips in Spain. Thunberg also received Peruvian specimens from Cavanilles; they may stem from Dombey or from Ruiz and Pavon.
- *Collinson, Peter* (1694-1768), (TL-2/1: 528), specimens labelled "Collins(on) ex America boreali" are probably duplicates from the Linnaean herbarium; the location of Collinson's original herbarium is not known.

- *Forselles, Jacob Hemic af* (1785-1855), Swedish mining engineer in the Sala (Västmanland) silver mines; plants "in Finlandiae littoribus".

After his death his collections went to Gustaf Johan Billberg (1772-1844) (TL-2/1: 215), with whom he had arranged that the collections of the first of them to die would go to the other. Part of the Billberg collection went through G.J. Billberg's children to [[Collection BM|BM]].
- *Forster, Johan Reinhold* (1729-1798) and *Forster, Johan Georg Adam* (1754-1794) (TL-2/1: 859-861 and 857-859), a considerable number of plants from Cook's second voyage (1772-1775); see H.O. Juel, Sv. Linné-Sällsk. Årsskr. 7: 68-82. 1924 for a discussion of the importance of Thunberg's set of Forster plants. – A number of sheets in the Thunberg herbarium carry the annotation "Forster, Botany Bay". This Bay, in Australia, was an important collecting area of Banks and Solander on Cook's *first* voyage; the Forsters did not visit this region.
- *Freyreiss, Georg Wilhelm* (1789-1825), (TL-2/1: 877-878), important set of plants collected in the Rio de Janeiro region and in Minas Geraes ("Villa Rica", now Ouro Preto). Freyreiss was employed 1815-1818 by Lorentz Westin (q.v.), which explains why most Freyreiss plants in the Thunberg herbarium carry both names. – Freyreiss's plants were described in *Plantarum brasiliensium* dec. 1, 2, 1817, 1818.
- *Gåsevadsholm*. The garden of Clas Alströmer (q.v.) at Gåsevadsholm, south of Göteborg, Sweden. Some plants so labelled are in the Thunberg herbarium.

- *Gestrin, Samuel* (1764-1815), Swedish teacher at Gävle who owned a natural history cabinet. Some specimens "in alpibus genitidis" collected by Gestrin; it is not certain that these plants were indeed collected by S. Gestrin.

- *Hortus hafniensis Georgii*, Thunberg collected in the old Amaliegade botanical garden of Copenhagen in 1770; the indication Georgii refers to Georg Christian Oeder (1728-1791), director 1752-1770, TL-2/3: 803-807.

- *Hortus parisiensis*,... The *Jardin des plantes*, also called *Jardin du Roi*, Paris. Several travellers sent plants to Thunberg collected in the Paris garden such as the gardener Broberg and the physician Mellerborg. A number of sheets from the Paris garden carry no collector's name; some may have been sent by Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu.
- *Hortus trianonensis*,... the garden connected with the Trianon at Versailles. A few plants in the Thunberg herbarium stem from this garden collected by Linnaean and Thunberg students. Thunberg himself visited the garden in July 1770.

Both the Alströmer and Thunberg herbaria have specimens labelled "Pentz China". However, Pentz is not known to have visited China; the plants must stem from a different collector.
- *Pihl, C.F*., a Swedish physician who collected at Porto-Bello, Panama; 50 species in [[Collection SBT|SBT]], some duplicates in Thunberg herb.
- *Poiret, Jean-Louis-Marie*, (1755-1834), (TL-2/4: 319-321), plants from N. Africa.

This is difficult to identify since Thunberg annotated such specimens as "Ex insulis amer. calid. per Vahl" or "Ex insulae Trinitatis per Vahl".
- *Rosén, Eberhard* (1714-1796), (TL-2/4: 887), plants from S. Sweden labelled "Rosén" may stem from Eberhard rather than Nils Rosén (1706-1773).

- *Schweigger, August Friedrich* (1783-1821), (TL-2/5: 428-430), plants from Austria and the Pyrenees ("Schweiger" and "Schweigger").
- *Scopoli, Joannes Antonius* (Giovanni Antonio) (1723-1788), (TL-2/5: 453-456). The Scopoli material in the Thunberg herbarium consists of specimens of plants grown in the Uppsala Botanic Garden from seed sent by Scopoli to Linnaeus ("cult. in hort. Ups. sem. ex Italia Scopoli").
- *Sibthorp, John* (1758-1796), (TL-2/5: 577-580). Thunberg received from J.E. Smith plants collected by Sibthorp in Greece.
- *Smith, James Edward* (1759-1828), (TL-2/5: 678-691). Thunberg obtained many plants from Smith. These are mostly annotated with the name of the original collector, but there are also annotations "p. Smith". A collection from Norfolk Island, collected by Ferdinand Bauer, is thus designated; the plants from Greece were collected by J. Sibthorp; early collections from Australia are from John White. Smith also sent duplicates from the Linnaean herbarium to Thunberg.
- *Solander, Daniel* \[*Carlsson*\] (1733-1782), (TL-2/5: 721-723), many specimens collected by Banks and Solander on Cook's first voyage, see under J. Banks for further details.
