#### Note

"For over 50 years I have sent herbarium specimens all over the world. Most of these are at Duke University, Durham, N.C. I have collected herbarium specimens in nearly every state of the U.S.A. I am now a retired M.D. and doing more collecting then ever before in my life. Although 78 years old I am in good health and will collect everything that grows and belongs to the vegetable kingdom. I started to collect in 1904 in Wisconsin; then from 1910-1942 I lived and collected in North Carolina. I was in the M.C. Army out in the Western U.S.A. from 1943-1945 and did a lot of collecting in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. Many of my specimens have been sent to Chicago Museum of Natural History, to Universities of Wisconsin, Illinois, California, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida and many other places", (in litt. to FAS, 1957). Schallert's main herbarium is now at SMU.
