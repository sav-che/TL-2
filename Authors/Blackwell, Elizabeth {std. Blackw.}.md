##### n.546. Herbarium blackwellianum

**Title**
*Herbarium blackwellianum* emendatum et auctum id est Elizabethae Blackwell collectio stirpium quae in pharmacopoliis ad medicum usum asservantur quarum descriptio et vires ex anglico idiomate in latinum conversae sistuntur... \[other t.p.: Vermehrtes und verbessertes Blackwellisches Kräuterbuch...\] Nürnberg 1747-1773, 6 vols. Fol.
**Abbreviated title**: *Herb, blackwell.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: The text of this greatly superior Nürnberg version is mostly in German and Latin. The five hundred Blackwell plants are reproduced in five centuries in their original order, and there is an extra century. Altogether there are 616 coloured copper engravings of plants used in pharmacy, but including some poisonous and ornamental plants in the sixth century. Except for the last few plates the engraving is by N. F. Eisenberger and the numbering is 1 to 600. There is one unnumbered plate representing Viscum Mancanillae, and forming the additional coloured title page of the sixth century. Two plates (a, b) were issued for Nos. 269, 322, 341, 497, 498, 522, 523, 536, 539, 547, 573 and 600, and three (a, b, c) for no. 574. No. 75 was re-issued in a corrected version, and both may occur in subscribers' copies (e.g., at K.)
Publication was started in 1747 by the painter Eisenberger on a subscription basis, the work being issued in instalments. It was inspired and controlled until his death by C.J. Trew, who wrote the lengthy text for the first ninety plates, a text provided in addition to a translation of the brief notes in Blackwell. Thereafter the text was supervised by the botanist C. G. Ludwig of Leipzig, but others, mainly G. R. Böhmer of Wittenberg, and E. G. Bose of Leipzig, actually wrote it. Ludwig was assisted by F. A. G. Knolle in producing the last century.
The text was published simultaneously with the plates until 1749, but thereafter was always in arrears, Trew being mainly responsible for the delay. The dates of the prefaces in the first three centuries, and of the title-pages in the last three, therefore only indicate the date of publication of the last pages of the relevant text. The dates of the title-pages are 1750, 1754, 1757, 1760, 1765 and 1773, and of the prefaces 1 Jun 1752, 3 Mar 1755, 2 Jan 1758, 6 Dec 1759, 31 Jan 1765 and Nov 1772. Trew delayed the first preface against Eisenberger's expectation, in order to include lengthy catalogues of his books with the first century. A reprint dated 1757 of the title-page for this century, by the printer of centuries two to five, is found in the publisher's complete copies (e.g. at British Museum, Bloomsbury; and BMNH) as distinct from subscription copies. The size of the first seven instalments of plates and text is known, but not of the remaining thirty-one instalments for the 500 plates of the Blackwell Herbal paper, nor of the fewer instalments of text. For further details see Tjaden (1972) upon whose article this paragraph is based and the reviews in the Tübingische Ber. gel. Sachen which provide even more detail (BH) – *Copies*: HU, NY.
