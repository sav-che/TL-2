### Author

Bauer, Franz Andreas (1758-1840), Austrian botanical artist who lived and worked in England from 1788 until his death. "Botanick painter to His Majesty," "der grösste Pflanzenmahler" (PR), brother of Ferdinand Lukas Bauer. 
**Abbreviated name**: *F. A. Bauer* \[standard form in IPNI: *F.A.Bauer*\]

#### Original drawings

A large collection of original drawings in pencil and in watercolour (e.g. 127 of British Orchids) is preserved at BM (from the Banksian library). The collection includes plates published in works by W. Aiton, A. B. Lambert, W. J. Hooker and by F. A. Bauer himself, as well as many unpublished ones. Seven drawings of species of *Erica* made for the *Delineations of exotick plants* are at K, seventeen at BM. Bauer was employed by Banks at an annual salary. All drawings made by him during these years became the property of Banks (Dawson). The University Library of Göttingen holds the legacy of Franz Andreas Bauer, received from King Ernst August of Hannover in Nov 1841 and Jan 1842. This legacy contains probably half of the papers and drawings left by Bauer on his death. The collections at Göttingen consists of 20 volumes (and one volume of views from Greece by Ferdinand Lukas Bauer) of which volume 15 (60 coloured engravings of *Erica* species) is lost. The remaining volumes contain a great many drawings, water colours and manuscript annotations on a great variety of mostly botanical subjects. For further details see NI sub no. 99.

|part	|*plates*	|text (special matter)	|dates|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|1	|Fruct. 1-3, 6, 8-10; Genera 1-3	|prospectus \[3 p.\]	|Nov-Dec 1830|

The years are given on the wrappers; the prospectus (part 1) is dated Nov 1830, the prefatory remarks (part 4) 24 Oct 1838. Plates 16-20 are dated 1 Dec 1837; the years in which Bauer made the drawings are given on each plate. – The Berlin copy contains a reprint of part 1, dated 1838. This date appears only on the original wrapper. The title on the wrappers is "The genera and species of orchidaceous plants by John Lindley ... illustrated by..." a title confusingly close to that of the entirely different octavo publication by Lindley, 1830-1840, entitled "The genera and species of orchidaceous plants." – The 35 plates are handcoloured or uncoloured lithographs; 28 plates are by F. A. Bauer, 7 other plates are of drawings by Lindley after sketches made by Bauer (Fruct. 1, 3, 6, 9, Gen. 1-3). A facsimile reprint was announced, but not \[yet\] published, by Asher 1974.
