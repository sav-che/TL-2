### Author

Née, Isidore Charles Sigismond (1784-1837), fictitious botanist said to have explored South America. 
**Abbreviated name**: *==Name in the standard form is not specified==.*

#### Note

One of the fictitious botanists appearing in Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography (4: 486. 1888). Barnhart (J. New York Bot. Gard. 20: 177. 1919) points out that the name is obviously compounded from those of Carl Sigismund Kunth (1788-1850) and Louis Née; the author is stated to have published a *Flora mexicana* (2 vols., Paris 1827) and various treatises on mexican hieroglyphs.
