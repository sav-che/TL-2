### Author

Bonelli, Giorgio (1724-1782), Italian botanist. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Bonelli*

#### Herbarium and types

in the Liberato Sabbati herbaria. The Hortus Romanus was mainly Sabbati's work, but in which of his six different herbaria (in various libraries at Rome, see Saccardo) the Hortus romanus plants are preserved, if at all, is unknown to us. – Correspondence with Allioni at Torino.
*Ref*.: Saccardo 1: 34, 2: 21.

### Publications

##### n.634. Hortus romanus

**Title**
*Hortus romanus* juxta systema Tournefortianum paulo strictius distributus a Georgio Bonelli...specierum nomina suppeditante, praestantiorum, quas ipse selegit, adumbrationem dirigente Liberato Sabbati. Roma (Bouchard et Gravier) 1772-1793, 8 vols. Broadsheet.
**Abbreviated title**: *Hort. rom.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: 800 hand-coloured plates. Bonelli contributed only a short text to volume I. The remaining volumes were edited by N. Martelli, but the book was actually the work of Liberato and Constantino Sabbati. NI saw the original prospectus (at Heidelberg): 300 copies were to be printed, of which only some were to be coloured. It is not likely that this number was actually reached, certainly not for the later volumes (vols. 6-8 are very scarce). *Copies*: HU (1-5), MO (1-8), NY (2-4). – 100, invariably poor and crude, plates per volumes; vol. 1 has an extra plate deplcting the garden, vols 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 have each a portrait. See HU for further details.
