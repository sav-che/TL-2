Kerry), studied civil engineering, Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, emigrated to Australia 1856, Deputy Surveyor General of New South Wales 1873, Chief Mining Surveyor 1874-1882, retired 1887, F.L.S. 1874, Royal Society New South Wales 1876, received a number of awards for his work on orchids, died 13 Aug 1892 at Hunter's Hill, Sydney. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Fitzg.* \[standard form in IPNI: *Fitzg.*\]

#### Note

Confusion persists concerning both his surname (1) Fitzgerald vs. FitzGerald, and (2) his Christian names, Robert David vs. Robert Desmond. His grandson and namesake (1902-1987), a well-known Australian poet, cited him as Robert David FitzGerald. However, Fitzgerald would be the more usual form of the surname in Ireland. Records of Univ. College, Cork (formerly Queen's College, Cork), give his full name as Robert David Fitzgerald, junior; his father being Robert David Fitzgerald. He matriculated at Queen's College on 21 Oct 1851. E. Charles Nelson (pers. comm.) also has a record of him matriculating at Trinity College, Dublin, on 1 Jul 1847. In neither college is there a record of his graduation. The former school only has him matriculating in the Faculty of Engineering. Robert David Fitzgerald also is easily confused with Robert Desmond Fitzgerald (1914-1990), a Canadian botanist.
