### Author

Clifford, George (1685-1760), Dutch banker, governor of the Dutch East Indian Company, trustee of the *Hortus medicus* in Amsterdam and owner of the estate De Hartecamp south of Haarlem (near Bennebroek). 
**Abbreviated name**: *Clifford*

#### Herbarium and types

Clifford's herbarium was acquired by Sir Joseph Banks in 1792 and is at the Botany Department of the [[Collection BM|British Museum]] (Natural History). It is important because it provided the basis for Linnaeus's *Hortus Cliffortianus* and *Viridiarum Cliffortianum*. After having been scattered through the general herbarium the specimens are now kept separately as a special herbarium arranged in accordance with the *Hortus Cliffortianus*; the size of the sheets is 41-45 × 26-28 cm. Linnaeus's handwriting is found on many sheets. Occasional Clifford specimens are at [[Collection OXF|OXF]]. The story of Banks's acquisition of the Clifford herbarium can be learned from his correspondence with the Leiden botanist Sebald Justinus Brugmans (1763-1819) who acted as an intermediary between the Twenth family, which possessed the herbarium at the time, and Banks. Brugmans reports on 16 April 1792 that he has bought for Banks Twenth's herbarium.
