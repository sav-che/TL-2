#### Note

Trail (1886), in his obituary of Croall: "The "British Sea Weeds" was nominally the joint production of W. G. Johnstone and Alexander Croall, but I have reason to know that nearly the whole of the work devolved on Croall, while the remuneration went to Johnstone, who died, or in some other way conveniently vanished before accounts were squared between them."
