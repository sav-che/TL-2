### Author

Don, George (1798-1856), British plant collector and nurseryman, brother of David Don. 
**Abbreviated name**: *G. Don* \[standard form in IPNI: *G.Don*\]

#### Herbarium and types

[[Collection BM|BM]], bought from the Royal Horticultural Society for which Don had collected in West Africa and South America. Hitchcock cites [[Collection E|E]] as the place where Don's types are kept. This is based on Urban's statement "herbarium proprium Donianum olim apud Prof. MacNab in urbe Edinburgh" and on Candolle's Phytographie (p. 408). Probably confused with his father George Don 1764-1814 (see also Notes R. bot. Gard. Edinburgh 3: 49-290). [[Collection BM|BM]] has 701 nos.; [[Collection E|E]] has mosses; further material at [[Collection CGE|CGE]] (via Lindley), [[Collection BR|BR]], [[Collection E|E]], [[Collection GOET|GOET]], [[Collection K|K]], [[Collection LD|LD]], [[Collection MO|MO]], [[Collection OXF|OXF]].
