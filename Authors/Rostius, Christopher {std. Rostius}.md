### Author

Rostius, Christopher (1620-1687), German-born Swedish physician and botanist; Dr. med. Leiden 1657; "General-gouvernements-medicus" in the province of Skåne from 1658; first professor of medicine (incl. botany) and "archiater" at Lund University 1667-1676. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Rostius* \[standard form in IPNI: *Rostius*\]

#### Herbarium and types

Rostius' "Herbarium vivum" (now at [[Collection LD|LD]]) is dated 1610 (hence not collected by himself) but was probably brought together in the 1580's or 90's possibly (at least partly) from the Botanical Garden at Leiden. It contains 372 specimens (mainly cultivated plants) glued on to paper sheets bound in one volume and annotated with unitary or binary latin names, sometimes also with vernacular names in German. There are no localities. It was used by Rostius and his successors when teaching botany for the medical students. No doubt it was seen also by Linnaeus.
