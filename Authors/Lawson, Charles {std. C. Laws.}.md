#### Composite works

For "*Lawson's Pinetum*" see under E. J. Ravenscroft. The book was originally issued by Peter and Charles Lawson and printed at their private press. The plates issued with the first 23 fascicles bear the original designation. The text, however, was compiled by Ravenscroft, the botanical descriptions were contributed by John Lindley (pars 1-3), Andrew Murray (4-37) and Maxwell T. Masters (38-52) (see Gard. Chron. 1904(2): 36-37).
