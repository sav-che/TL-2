[^1]: "*Aikinia* R.Br. 1832 (Gesneriaceae) \[is dedicated to\] Arthur Aikin (17731854), British chemist, botanist, mineralogist, member of Society of Arts London (Brown, 1832: 65, 66). First Wallich (1832: 46) had named for him *Aikinia elegans* in the Poaceae. Because there had already been the same plant in an earlier genus *Ratzeburgia* Kunth, he asked Brown to name the new genus in the Gesneriaceae after Arthur Aikin, who was a son to John Aikin. 
*Note*. – *Aikinia* Salisb. ex A.DC. 1830 (Campanulaceae) \[is dedicated to\] Aikin, John (1747–1822), British physician and naturalist (Candolle, 1830: 135)."
