- Barnhart, J.H., J. New York Bot. Gard. 20: 179. 1919.

#### Note

One of the most ingeniously depicted fictitious botanists featured in Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, 6: 75-76. 1889 (see Barnhart 1919). Thibaudin was said to have "landed in Concepcion early in February, 1777, journeyed for months through the pampas \[sic\] and the mountains, and formed a rich herbarium". On his return in France in 1785 "he was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences"; his works included e.g. "Descriptions des plantes recueillir \[sic\] dans un voyage au Pérou et au Chili", 2 vols., Paris 1786 and a "Prodrome de la flore du Chili avec un herbier explicatif 4 vols., 1788. – Conde (1958) accepted these fictitious authors uncritically, even added some minor details, and in this case changed the name to "C.A. Thibaudt".
