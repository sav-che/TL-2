### Publications

##### n.1738. Enumeratio methodica plantarum

**Title**
*Enumeratio methodica plantarum* horti medici Helmstadiensis subjuncta stirpium rariorum vel nondum satis extricatarum descriptione. Helmstedt (Litteris Ioannis Drimbornii) 1759. Oct.
**Abbreviated title**: *Enum.*

**Notes**
*Ed. 1*: 1759 (GGA 3 Jan 1760; Nederl. Letter-Courant 29 Jan 1760), p. \[i-viii\], \[1\]-239.
*Copy*: USDA.
*Ed. 2*: Sep-Dec 1763, "Editio secunda auctior, " Helmstedt (id.) 1763, Oct., p. \[i-xxxvi\], \[1\]-448, index \[12\]. *Copies*: M, US, USDA. – Since Kuntze's statement that the names in Adanson's Familles des plantes vol. 2 have priority over those of Fabricius in this edition, it has been customary to accept this. The first review of the book known to me appeared only in December 1764 \[sic\] (GGA 1764(2): 1204. 13 Dec 1764). Fabricius cites Nonne's *Flora in territorio erfordensi indigena* of 1763, but no other 1763 publications. In the absence of definite information priority should be given to Adanson (Fam. Pl. 2: Jul-Aug 1763).
*Ed.3*: 1776, "Enumerado... Helmstadiensis secundum Linnei et Heisteri systema digesta stirpium rariorum vel nondum satis extricatarum descriptione subjuncta. Editio tertia auctior posthuma." Helmstedt (Ioan. Henr. Kühnlin) 1776, p. \[i-xxxvi\], \[1\]-448, index \[12\] \[all this a reissue of the 1763 ed., followed by:\] Supplementum \[1\]-24. The title page is a cancellans t.p. for that of ed. 2; the supplement is the only new material of 1776. *Copy*: US.
The Enumeratio is of importance because of its use of the Heister system and generic names. Many names published by Heister in the *Systema plantarum* of 1748 were validated by Fabricius. See Dandy, List (1967). Rauschert (1968) and Holub (1970) are of the opinion that the *Enumeratio* of 1759 is essentially a list of names of species which are often uninominal and which should not be considered generic names. Dandy (1967, p. 12) has shown that the generic names are typographically distinguished by capitals. Most of the new names are attributed to Heister or other authors. In all those cases where the works of these earlier authors cited by Heister contain validating definitions, Fabricius' generic names are to be accepted. Rauschert's argument that most of these names are uninominal designations of species is difficult to accept since Fabricius clearly used the categories of genus and species and printed generic names in capitals. The fact that often a genus was represented by only one species in the Helmstedt garden is irrelevant for the standing of the generic names. The names *Cerefolium* and *Myrrhis*, accepted by Rauschert, are printed in exactly the same way as the "uninominal" designations rejected by him.
Dandy's criteria of validation by means of author reference or by means of the key are fully in agreement with the Code. See, however, also the detailed study by Holub (1970).
