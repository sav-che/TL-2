### Author

Holm, Herman Theodor (1854-1932), Danish born botanist; pupil of Warming; on the Denmark North Polar Expedition (1882-1884); settled in the U.S.A. in 1888; at the U.S. National Museum 1888-1893; pathologist in the U.S.D.A. 1893-1897; later associated with the Catholic University (LCU). 
**Abbreviated name**: *Holm*

#### Herbarium and types

[[Collection LCU|LCU]]; for duplicates see IH. – Holm planned to leave his herbarium and library to the University library of Leuven (Louvain) because of the destruction of his library during World War I. It is not clear why this intention was never realized; neither [[Collection LV|LV]], not the Universiteitsbibliotheek at Leuven have any Holm material (inf. E. Petit).
