### Author

Forsström, Johan Eric (1775-1824), Swedish clergyman and botanist who travelled in Lapland, Finmark and the West Indies (1803-1815), pupil of Thunberg. (*Forsström*).

#### Herbarium and types

The largest set of W. Indian plants is at [[Collection S|S]] (via Swartz), other sets are at [[Collection BM|BM]], [[Collection LD|LD]], [[Collection NY|NY]], [[Collection SBT|SBT]] and [[Collection UPS|UPS]] (general herb, and Thunberg). The Thunberg herbarium also has plants from Lapland and Finmark (1800). Forsström sent plants directly from the West Indies to the Swedish Academy of Sciences ([[Collection SBT|SBT]]) and to Uppsala University. His personal collections went to Johan Billberg (1772-1844), whose collections were split up after his death. Part of them reached [[Collection BM|BM]] via J. G. Children.
