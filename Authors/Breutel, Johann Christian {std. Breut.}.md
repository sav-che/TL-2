### Author

Breutel, Johann Christian (1788-1875), German Moravian bishop (1853-1875), botanist at Herrnhut, travelled in the West Indies and South Africa. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Breut.* \[standard form in IPNI: *Breutel*\]

#### Herbarium and types

Original herbarium [[Collection GLM|GLM]], important sets of duplicates [[Collection LZ|LZ]] (ferns), [[Collection B|B]] (hepat.), [[Collection BM|BM]] (mosses). Breutel (directly or through Hohenacker) offered many series of plants for sale (mostly unnumbered) which are in many herbaria. A series of formal exsiccatae was *Flora germanica exsiccata*, ser. II. *Cryptogamia*, centuries 1-5, nos. 1-500, Leipzig 1832-1862 (see Sayre 1969, 1975 for extensive details) sets of which are e.g. at [[Collection BM|BM]], [[Collection FH|FH]], [[Collection HBG|HBG]], [[Collection L|L]], [[Collection LE|LE]], [[Collection NY|NY]], [[Collection PC|PC]], [[Collection S|S]], [[Collection S|S]]-PA. His plants from the West Indies 1840-1841, and from South Africa (1853-1854) are in many herbaria. The first century of the *Flora germanica exsiccata* is identical with the third century of Reichenbach's series of that same name. De Candolle mentions *Filices capenses et antillanae* at [[Collection W|W]], and *Musci frondosi exsiccati*, the latter a name appearing on parts of a reissue (see Sayre). Breutel issued several other named series of which it is not certain that they were regular exsiccatae, e.g. *Plantae africae australis*.
