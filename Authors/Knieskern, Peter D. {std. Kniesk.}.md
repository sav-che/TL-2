**Abbreviated name**: *Kniesk.*

#### Herbarium and types

[[Collection CHRB|CHRB]]; further material at [[Collection B|B]], [[Collection BR|BR]], [[Collection C|C]], [[Collection DWC|DWC]], [[Collection L|L]], [[Collection NY|NY]], [[Collection US|US]]. – Knieskern's herbarium changed hands several times after his death but was finally acquired by H. H. Rusby who presented it to [[Collection CHRB|CHRB]] in 1928; it was in bad condition and much of it had to be discarded. Part of the material came to [[Collection NY|NY]] via Princeton University (inf. D. E. Fairbrothers).
