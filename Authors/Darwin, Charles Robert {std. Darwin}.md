#### Note

The literature on Darwin and his work is immense. No attempt is made here even to present a review of the most important biographies and studies. In a work on taxonomic literature, however, Darwin should have his place, even if only symbolic, because of his immense influence also on the development of ideas in taxonomy leading to the development of modern evolutionary biology. For a list of the main recent literature on Darwin see Smit p. 904-913.
