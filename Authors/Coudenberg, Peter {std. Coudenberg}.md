### Author

Coudenberg, Peter (*fl*. 1566), Belgian apothecary at Antwerp, correspondent of Clusius. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Coudenberg*

#### Herbarium

Coudenberg made a herbarium of local Belgian plants, wild and cultivated, with the addition of mediterranean material. This herbarium, dated 1566, is the oldest known herbarium of the Low Countries; it was discovered in a private collection, acquired by the Los Angeles Biomedical Library and subsequently given to the Biohistorical Institute of the University of Utrecht. Attribution to Coudenberg is tentative, and based on internal evidence as well as on the presence of Coudenberg's initials on the front page of the herbarium book.
