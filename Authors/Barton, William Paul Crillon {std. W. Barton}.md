##### n.325. Compendium florae philadelphicae

**Title**
*Compendium florae philadelphicae*: containing a description of the indigenous and naturalized plants found within a circuit of ten miles around Philadelphia. Philadelphia (M. Carey & Son) 1818, 2 vols. Duod. (in sixes).
**Abbreviated title**: *Comp. fl. philadelph.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: Early Aug 1818 – 1: \[i-viii\], \[1\]-251, 2: \[1\]-234. *Copy*: Ewan. – "The *Compendium* was copyrighted 9 July 1818, the preface was dated 11 July 1818. Nuttall is cited throughout, but it is apparent from the preface that this was possible by access to the Nuttall manuscripts or proof-sheets; in the addenda at the end are included two plants collected June 1818, and one July 1818; the work was probably issued early in August 1818" \[J. H. Barnhart\]. In the light of Barnhart's remarks Kuntze's assumption that the book was issued about January 1818 is untenable. The book did *not* antedate Nuttall's *Genera* \[May 1818\]. The first review known to us is of 1 Jan 1819 (Amer. Med. Rec. Philadelphia 2(5): 86-89).

*Copy* in original covers at NY. Covers dated. The six pages \[i-vi\] preface material in fasc. 1 contained \[i\] h.t.; \[iii\], t.p. dated 1820; \[iv\] registration 1 Aug 1820; \[v, vi\] adv.; p. \[iii-vi\] of this material was obviously usually replaced by the new preface material issued with fasc. 12 which has on p. \[ii\] the registration date 1 Jul 1821. The half title \[i\] in fasc. 1 is usually retained and then precedes \[i\] of fasc. 12. Other *copies*: H, HU (2), MO, NY (2), US. – The covers of fasc. 1-3 have "... illustrated by original coloured figures...", "original" also on h.t.'s.
No copies in original wrappers of vols. 2 and 3 have come to our attention. They were also published in parts but contents and dates are not known. *Copies*: as above.
