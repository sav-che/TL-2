### Author

Salisbury, Richard Anthony (né Markham) (1761-1829), British botanist, gardener and botanical artist; educated at Edinburgh Univ.; had a garden at Chapel Allerton, Yorkshire; later owner of P. Collinson's garden at Mill Hill, London; secretary Hort. Soc. London 1805-1816. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Salisb.*

#### Herbarium and types

Some material (from the garden at Chapel Allerton) at [[Collection BM|BM]] (through J. Banks); no material at [[Collection K|K]] (see D. Meikle in *Note* 2, below). Several manuscripts and drawings (9 vols.) at [[Collection BM|BM]] (for letters to J. Banks see Dawson p. 729-730); some of Salisbury's notes and drawings of ericaceous plants may be at [[Collection K|K]] (Woodward 1904; R.D. Meikle in lit.).

#### Note

- (1) Son of Richard Markham; assumed the name Salisbury as a condition of a legacy (see e.g. Dawson p. 729-730).
- (2) "It is true that the Burchell herbarium is incorporated in the general collections at Kew, but there is no evidence that it includes, or ever included, any Salisbury specimens, nor has anyone here ever seen a Salisbury specimen in our collections. Thanks to the kindness of H.M. Burdet (Conserv. et Jard. Bot., Genève), I have been able to trace the source of A.DC.'s statement. In 1877 De Candolle sent Sir W.J. Hooker a manuscript list of British authors, asking if he could say where their herbaria were located. Bentham returned the list in June 1878, and against Salisbury's name noted "la plupart (ou la totalité?) dans l'herbier de Burchell à Kew". The grounds for Bentham's annotation are obscure, perhaps he was misled by J.E. Gray's comment (in the preface to R.A. Salisbury, Genera of Plants, v; 1866) "... on the death of Mr. Salisbury, in 1829, the son (Dr. W.J. Burchell) inherited part of his property, and with some (I doubt if all) of his Mss.... Dr. Burchell died in 1864... The botanical collections were then given by his surviving sister to Sir William Hooker for the Kew Herbarium". Had Bentham read further, however, he would have seen that Burchell's sister deliberately excluded the Salisbury collections from the gift to Kew; moreover from what J.E. Gray says it is clear that the Salisbury *reliquiae* consisted only of manuscripts, letters, published papers and "a cabinet of seeds and fragments of plants". Part of this collection, including the specimens, was given by Gray to the British Museum, where it still remains. There is no evidence that Salisbury left a herbarium to Burchell, nor indeed is there any evidence that Salisbury ever possessed one. According to J.E. Gray (letter to A. De Candolle, dating 21st April, 1873, comm. Burdet) "R.A. Salisbury... cultivated and studied living plants. He had upwards of 2000 species in pots, in his little yard in Edgware Road after he had left his large garden at Mill Hill near London". If Salisbury had a herbarium, Gray makes no mention of it, though he was evidently very interested in Salisbury and his collections. It is safe to say that there are no Salisbury specimens at Kew, and if only to save others from fruitless enquiry, I think A. DC.'s statement should be corrected." \[D. Meikle, in lit. 30 Jun 1977\].

Salisbury for nos. 1-70. *Plate 14* large size (three times as large as the others) or cut in two as 14 and \[14bis\]. All plates with accompanying, unpaginated text (1-2 p.; *pl. 14*: 3 p.).

*2*(*2*): 1 Jun 1808-1 Sep 1808 (dates on plates), p. \[i, t.p., 2(2)\], *pl. 107-109, 110* ("*112*"), *111-117*, four lvs text for *71, 72, 73, 74* (cancellantia; main change: *Bartonia* changed to *Hibbertia* on *73*), *pl. 84, 93* and *111* double (analysis based on *copy* Teyler); other copies have also text for *pl. 118-122* (plates themselves never issued).
*Copies*: E, FI (incompl.), G, H-UB (incompl.), HH, NY, PH (incompl.), Teyler, USDA (*pl. 115-117* missing); IDC 629. – Part 1 of vol. 1 was apparently first issued with the above cited 1805 t.p. (copies: E, Teyler, USDA). In 1806 this part was reissued with a title-page stating that the descriptions were by R.A. Salisbury. On the 1805 title-page William Hooker's name is mentioned as "by William Hooker" which is the reason that he is often cited as the author. It is clear, however, that Hooker made the drawings and that Salisbury was reponsible for the descriptions and names. The plates are all dated; in general such dates were intended as dates of publication. These dates must be regarded as correct until there is evidence that actual publication took place at a later date. The book seems to have been issued in 40 parts from 1805 to 1808 (1809 according to Pritzel, but latest date on plates is 1 Sep 1808). The originals for the plates *1-70* (which make up vol. 1, parts 1 and 2) were perhaps the joint work of William Hooker and Salisbury; they are at BM together with the manuscripts of the descriptions. Volume 2 consists of the plates *71-117* whereas the descriptions run to *t. 122.* G.S. Bunyard states (see TL-2/2: 283), that some copies have two versions of the text belonging to plate *64*, one entitled *Anneslia falcifolia*, the other *Anneslia grandiflora*. John Collins (Sotheby 670) mentions also a cancelled (*Burtonia grossulariaefolia*) for a cancellans (*Hibbertia grossulariaefolia* of the text to *p. 73.* The artist William Hooker (1779-1832) was a pupil of Bauer; not to be confused with William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865).
