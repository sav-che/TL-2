### Author

Hill, John (1716-1775), British apothecary and naturalist; author of many compilations dealing with horticulture, botany or medicine. (*J. Hill*).

#### Herbarium and types

[[Collection A|A]] collection of British plants by Hill is in the British Herbarium of [[Collection BM|BM]]; some mss are at the Royal Society.

#### Name

Hill obtained the order of Vasa in 1774. It is on this ground that Hill assumed the prefix "Sir". According to the Gentleman's Magazine 1774: 282 "he was received at Court with the proper ensigns as Knight", which "affords evidence that the King – a stickler for etiquette – gave the necessary permission" (Druce 1926).

### Publications

##### n.2767. A general natural history

**Title**
*A general natural history*: or, new and accurate descriptions of the animals, vegetables, and minerals of the different parts of the world; with their virtues, and uses as far as hitherto certainly known, in medicine and mechanics: illustrated by a general review of the knowledge of the ancients, and the improvements and discoveries of later ages in these studies. Including the history of the materia medica, pictoria, and tinctoria of the present and earlier ages. As also observations on the neglected properties of many valuable substances known at present; and attempts to discover the lost medicines, &c. of former ages, in a series of critical enquiries into the materia medica of the ancient Greeks. With a great number of figures, elegantly engraved. By John Hill, M.D.... London (printed for Thomas Osborne,...) \[1748-\] 1751 \[-1752\], 3 vols. Qu. (in twos).
**Abbreviated title**: *Gener. nat. hist.*

**Notes**
*Vol. 2*: \[h.t.:\] "A history of plants", 1751, p. \[i\]-xxvi, 1-642, \[1-7, ind.\], *pl. 1-16* (uncol. copp.). *Copies*: LC, MICH, NY, PH (2), USDA. – See Henrey 809 for further copies; see Collins (Sotheby 345) for an analytical collation. (See also Junk. Catal. 206, no. 139. 1977). (*Hist. pl.*).
*Second ed*.: 1773. – See Kuntze (1891), Proskauer (1958) and Henrey no. 810. Only copies known at the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris and at the Library Company of Philadelphia. This edition differs in some respects from the original although the greater part of the book seems to consist of the old 1751 sheets, re-issued for the occasion. Proskauer and Kuntze enumerate the differences. The book as a whole must be regarded as an independent publication and has to be taken into account for purposes of botanical nomenclature (as far as the date is concerned). The copy at Philadelphia (analyzed by James Mears) is indeed almost identical with the 1751 issue. The copy lacks *pl. 10* but has an extra leaf p. 643-644 and an additional plate, on *Dionaea. Collation*: p. \[i\]-xxvi, \[1\]-644, \[1-7, ind.\], *pl. 1-9, 11-16, 1* unnumbered (*Dionaea*).

##### n.2768. The useful family herbal

**Title**

The whole intended for the use of families, and for the instructions of those who are desirous of relieving the distressed sick. London (W. Johnston... and W. Owen) 1754. Oct.
**Abbreviated title**: *Useful fam. herbal.*

**Notes**
*Orig. ed.*: 1754, p. \[i\]-vi, \[i\]-liv, \[1\]-404, *pl. 1-8* (uncol. copp.). *Copy*: NY. – Published anonymously.
*Second ed*. (reissue): 1755, p. \[i\]-vi, \[i\]-liv, \[1\]-404, *pl. 1-8* (id.). *Copies*: MO, USDA. – "The useful family herbal... distressed sick. By John Hill, M.D.... The second edition." London (id.) 1755. Oct.

*New edition*; 1789, p. \[i\]-xv, \[xvi, binder\], \[17\]-400, *pl. 1-8* (id.). *Copies*: NY, USDA. – "The useful family-herbal... a new edition, corrected." London (printed for A. Miller, W. Law, and R. Cater) York (Wilson and Spence).
*Bungay edition* (1): "*The family herbal*... embellished with fifty-four coloured plates."Bungay (printed and published by C. Brightly, and T. Kinnersley), s.d., possibly 1810 (fide Henrey 827), p. \[i\]-viii, \[i\]-xl, *pl. 1-2*, \[1\]-376, *pl. 1-53* (hand-col. copp.). *Copy*: HH.
*Bungay edition*(2): "*The family herbal*... embellished with fifty-four coloured plates." Bungay (printed and published by C. Brightly and Co. published also by T. Kinnersley) 1812. Oct. (in fours), p. \[i\]-xl, \[1\]-376, *pl. 1-35, 37-39, 42-43, 47-49*, plus *6* unnumbered pl. *Copy*: NY.

*Other issue of Bungay edition*: Bungay 1822 (Henrey 829) (n.v.) Hill describes a number of species under their English names and adds Latin names "under which they are found in every dictionary". These Latin names are sometimes unitary, sometimes binomials, trinomials, or polynomials. They must be regarded as not validly published. Binary nomenclature is not consistently applied (ICBN Art. 23); the unitary designations of species can not be taken as generic names. – The number of issues of *The family herbal* is possibly greater than listed here. Our information is incomplete. However, in view of the relatively modest importance of these later issues we did not pursue our searches beyond what is reported above. See also Henrey.

Upon completion the publishers started the issue of a "Royal impression of that elegant and useful work" (Henrey no. 799) on 29 Jan 1757.

The Linnaean system of binary nomenclature for species was not consistently followed (ICBN Art. 23). The book contains a number of pseudo-binomials. However, the generic names are designated as such and must be accepted for botanical nomenclature; for an extensive bibliographical study see HU; for an appraisal of the botanical and nomenclatural importance see Dandy (DA) and Steam (1967).

With the fast methods of culture for the several articles of the kitchen-garden: and the compleat management of the ground for raising them, in the natural and artificial manner. Compiled and digested from the papers of the late celebrated Mr. Hale, by the authors of the compleat body of husbandry. And comprehending the art of constructing a garden for use and pleasure; the best methods of keeping it in order; and the most perfect accounts of its several products. London (T. Osborne, T. Trye, S. Crowder and Co. and H. Woodgate) \[1756-\] 1757. Fol.
**Abbreviated title**: *Eden*.

**Notes**
*Publ*.: 28 Aug 1756-8 Nov 1757, frontisp., \[i\]-iv, \[i\], ii, \[iii-iv\], \[1\]-714, *pl. 1-60. Copies*: MO (*60 pl.*); IDC 7353.
Issued in weekly parts (so indicated), between August 1765 (last week) and October 1757.
According to the preface the book was issued so as to "accomodate the Publication to the season, that every week shall direct what is that week to be done."
The book was "compiled and digested from the papers of the late celebrated Mr. Hale by the authors of the *Compleat body of husbandry*" which here means evidently John Hill, who signed the dedication. *Eden* is a companion volume to *A complete body of husbandry*, London 1756, Fol., issued in the same way in fascicles. "Thomas Hale" is possibly "a convenient invention" (HU 557). "The true authorship of these two books is now unlikely to be finally determined, but as the books remain to us that does not particularly matter. Hill no doubt was connected in some way with their preparation or claimed to be so, to the confusion of his contemporaries and his latter critics" (Fussell).
"*Enlarged edition*": 1773, London (for the author), p. \[ii\], iv, ii, 714, \[1\], 714-716; portr. of author, front., 60 + 20 *pl*. (n.v., collation Henrey no. 805).
