### Author

Burser, Joachim (1583-1639), German physician and botanist, professor of botany and medecine at Sorö, Denmark (1625-1639), travelled in C. and S. Europe. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Burser*

#### Herbarium

[[Collection UPS|UPS]]. Important source for the interpretation of many Linnaean species. The herbarium is named and arranged according to Bauhin's *Pinax*. Seized by Charles X as booty in the 1657-58 war and taken to Sweden. Originally composed of 25 volumes (plus an unnumbered volume with Danish plants) of which vols. 2 and 5 were destroyed by fire in 1702. Sheets 20 × 35 cm. The specimens (ca. 3200) are often very representative and also often accompanied by more or less extensive citations of localities. The plants were mostly collected by Burser himself, other specimens were obtained from C. Bauhin, from the Leyden botanical garden, from "Brazil" (collected by an unknown French apothecary in Canada sic). Burser himself also sent specimens to C. Bauhin and the latter based many species on Burser material, species often also accepted by Linnaeus. For a complete catalogue see Juel 1936, for the concordance between Linnaeus and Burser see Savage 1937.
