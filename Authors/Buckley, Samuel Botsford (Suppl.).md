#### Herbarium and types

[[Collection A|A]], [[Collection ALU|ALU]], [[Collection B|B]] (ex [[Collection MO|MO]]), [[Collection BM|BM]] (375), [[Collection BR|BR]], [[Collection CGE|CGE]], [[Collection DBN|DBN]], [[Collection DWC|DWC]], [[Collection F|F]], [[Collection G|G]], [[Collection GA|GA]], [[Collection GH|GH]], [[Collection ISC|ISC]], [[Collection KSC|KSC]] (ex [[Collection MO|MO]]), [[Collection LE|LE]], [[Collection LIV|LIV]], [[Collection MEL|MEL]], [[Collection MO|MO]] (orig. herb. to ca. 1858?; duplicates distributed ca. 1889 as "ex Shaw School of Botany"), [[Collection NA|NA]], [[Collection NY|NY]] (incl. [[Collection WECO|WECO]], Hamilton College & [[Collection DPU|DPU]]; lichens ex Fred. L. Sargent ex [[Collection MO|MO]]), [[Collection OXF|OXF]], [[Collection P|P]] (ex [[Collection CN|CN]]), [[Collection P|P]]-DU, pf (= Paul Fryxell), [[Collection PH|PH]], [[Collection TEX|TEX]], [[Collection US|US]], [[Collection W|W]].
*Nota bene*: Buckley had a large number of botanical correspondents and an active exchange, both in the US and Europe. At one point in the 1840s he attempted to support himself as a collector by selling specimens and he sent material to Wm. Pamphlin (sic?) of London on consignment. Later, when he was more prosperous Buckley purchased collections such as Lindheimer's Fascicles I-IV and Fendler's Venezuelan ferns.
In addition to vascular plants, there is evidence that Buckley collected mosses, lichens, and algae. The present location(s) of these cryptogamic collections is not clear. He was also an important horticultural collector supplying Parsons & Co., Flushing, Long Island with thousands of roots and shrubs from the Southern Appalachians. He made wood specimens in Texas for Charles S. Sargent's Forestry Report in the 10th Census. They went to the Jesup Collection of the American Museum of Natural History, but have since been destroyed.
*Types*: Buckley described 6 genera and 210 species of vascular plants.
- (1) Buckley worked closely with Torrey and Gray in preparing his first (1843) botanical paper; lectotype material is consequently in [[Collection NY|NY]] and [[Collection GH|GH]], isotypes are widely scattered.
- (2) Buckley studied his Texas collections (those made from 1859 to 1861) at [[Collection PH|PH]] and had access to Elias Durand's herbarium, which subsequently was deposited in Paris ([[Collection P|P]]-DU). Buckley based new species on his own collections and those of Nuttall, Wright, Fendler, etc., which had been deposited earlier in [[Collection PH|PH]]. Gray borrowed Buckley's new Texas species from Durand and [[Collection PH|PH]] and wrote several articles criticizing Buckley's work. Gray kept "kleptotypes" of some of this material. Of Buckley's own collections from this period I do not think there are duplicates outside of [[Collection PH|PH]], [[Collection P|P]]-DU, and [[Collection GH|GH]].
- (3) In 1883 Buckley sent specimens from Texas to the Torrey Botanical Club. A few new species described by Buckley were based on these plants and the types are at [[Collection NY|NY]], I have not seen duplicates elsewhere.
Consequently, despite the fact that [[Collection MO|MO]] has Buckley's original herbarium, [[Collection MO|MO]] is not an important source of type material.
