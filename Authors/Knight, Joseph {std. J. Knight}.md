### Publications

##### n.3759. On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae

**Title**
*On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae*, with their generic as well as specific characters and places where they grow wild. \[London (William Savage)\] 1809. Qu.
**Abbreviated title**: *Cult. Prot.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: Dec 1809, p. \[i\]-xix, \[1\]-127, \[128, ind.\], err. slip. *Copies*: G, NY, USDA. â€“ Preface and frontispiece both dated 1 Aug 1809. This shows that dates on plates are not necessarily dates of publication, since it is unlikely that Knight's preface was dated the day the book appeared. In the preface, Knight says "Perhaps few works have greater claims to originality than the present, not a single line being copied from any other. For the names only of the different Genera, their various authors are quoted, except those of R. A. Salisbury, Esq. whose manuscripts have been found so useful in every sheet." This implies that we have to accept the text as written by Knight himself, the new names "ex" rather than "in". He does in fact credit Salisbury with many names equally with R. Brown, Banks, Linnaeus, etc. See, however, the discussion by Britten (1886) and by Stearn (1960).
