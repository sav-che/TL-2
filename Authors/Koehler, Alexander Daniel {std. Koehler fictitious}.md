### Author

Koehler, Alexander Daniel (1762-1828), \[fictitious\] German botanist stated to have worked with Mutis in Colombia and to have travelled in Brazil, Peru and Chile. (*==Name in the standard form is not specified==.*).

#### Note

One of the fictitious botanists created by an unknown contributor to Appleton's Dictionary of American Biography (ca. 1890) and cited by Barnhart as such (1919). Among the books cited for him are a *Flora brasiliensis* (4 vols., Berlin, 1821-1823), a *Flora venezuelensis* (4 vols., 1822), *Genera et species palmarum* (Stuttgart 1825), all obviously inspired by von Martius (1794-1868), and *Conspectus polygalorum florae Brasilicae meridionalis* (2 vols., Berlin 1827), inspired by Auguste de Saint-Hilaire (1799-1853).
