### Publications

##### n.2134. A natural arrangement of British plants

**Title**
*A natural arrangement of British plants*, according to their relations to each other, as pointed out by Jussieu, De Candolle, Brown, &c. including those cultivated for use; with an introduction to botany, in which the terms newly introduced are explained; illustrated by figures. London 1821, 2 vols. Oct.
**Abbreviated title**: *Nat. arr. Brit. pl.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: Vols. 1 (xxviii, 824 p., *21 pl.*) and 2 (viii, 757 p.): 1 Nov 1821. – The date of publication for volume one (10 Sep 1821), accepted by Sayre, is open to doubt. It is certain that the book was actually available only towards the end of the year; the plates are dated 1 Nov 1821; Peddy and Waddington give Jan 1822; (for more information see Rogers 1951). Stearn, (mss) also accepts 1 Nov 1821, the date in the book itself, since no evidence contradicts this date. Fries' *Systema mycologicum* vol. 1 was published on 1 Jan 1821 (arbitrary date under Art. 13 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature); W. J. Hooker's *Flora scotica* on 10 May 1821. – The subdivisions of genera can be regarded as sections.
J. E. Gray (1872): "The preface and the introduction to the study of Botany and its terms, occupying the half of the first volume containing the essence of the "Decandolle theory" and "Mirbel's Elements," were written by my father; the systematic synopsis of the plants, occupying the rest of the book, by myself, under my father's superintendence...." This statement does not mean that the taxa can be attributed to J. E. Gray; on the contrary, the author of the book is S. F. Gray for all purposes of nomenclatural citation.
