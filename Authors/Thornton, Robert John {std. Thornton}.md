### Publications

##### n.14.283. New Illustration of the sexual system

**Title**
*New Illustration of the sexual system* of Carolus von Linnaeus: comprehending an elucidation of the several parts of the fructification; a prize dissertation on the sexes of plants; a full explanation of the classes, and orders, of the sexual system; and the Temple of Flora, or garden of nature, being picturesque, botanical, coloured plates, of select plants, illustrative of the same, with descriptions... Shall Britons, in the field unconquer'd still, the better laurel lose? – In finer arts and public works shall they to Gallia yield?.. Thomson. By Robert John Thornton,... London (printed, for the publisher, by T. Bensley,...) 1807. Broadsheet.
**Abbreviated title**: *New ill. sex. syst.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: For a summary of the contents see Soulsby 772. Part I is "A new illustration of the sexual system of Linnaeus", part 2 a collection of 26 portraits and 91 botanical plates, part 3 "The temple of Flora". This *Temple of Flora* contains 31 coloured engraved plates. No two copies are alike because the plates were engraved by various processes, the impressions taken from them printed in colour and finished by hand, and altered in several instances thus producing various "states". See Grigson and Buchanan (1951), SO 772, NI 1955 and R. King for further details. – Copies vary considerably.
*Copies*: BR, K, NY, Teyler.
*Contemporary reissue of Temple of Flora*: London 1812, frontisp., p. \[i-xvii\], *30 pl*. with text.
*Copy*: NY. – NI 1955 mentions a quarto edition, London 1810, the so-called Lottery edition.

*Copy*: B. – NI mentions *21 pl*. for the Botanical abstracts, followed by a number \["75-80"\] of *Elementary botanical plates* which are regarded as vol. 3 of *The Philosophy of botany* (see below). The fourth volume is then the above mentioned *New ill. sex. syst.* 1799-1810. MO has a copy with the same title pages as the B copy, but with a different pagination (also mentioned by Tucker 3: 308 and described in Bot. Zeit. 18: 227-228. 1860) and with the plates in a separate volume (see below).
