### Author

Dombey, Joseph (1742-1794), French physician, naturalist, ethnographer and explorer of Peru, Chili and Brazil. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Dombey* \[standard form in IPNI: *Dombey*\]

#### Herbarium and types

Dombey made no formal herbarium, but the fate of his collections is such that they merit inclusion here. For an account of the odyssey of the Dombey collections, see Stafleu 1963 and Steele 1964. The French part of the collections was handed to L'Héritier de Brutelle for study and publication in early 1786, and was returned to [[Collection P|P]] after the latter's death in 1801. Many duplicates were sent out after 1801; and are now e.g. at [[Collection BM|BM]], [[Collection CGE|CGE]], [[Collection F|F]], [[Collection FI|FI]], [[Collection G|G]], [[Collection K|K]], [[Collection L|L]], [[Collection MO|MO]], [[Collection MPU|MPU]]. Important sets of duplicates went to Jussieu and Lamarck. The total collection (French part; except duplicates) numbered circa 1500. The fate of the Spanish part of the collections is unknown; they were claimed by the Spanish government on the arrival of Dombey at Cadiz in 1785. Dombey, who studied medicine at Montpellier, became interested in botany through Commerson and studied under Gouan at Montpellier and Lemonnier and Bernard de Jussieu at Paris. He was appointed médecin-botaniste at the Jardin du Roi 1775, to explore Spanish America, joined Ruiz and Pavon and stayed in S. America 1778-1784 (mainly Chile and Peru). Was sent to the United States in 1794 but captured by pirates and erroneously imprisoned by the French authorities at Montserrat where he died in prison.

#### Manuscripts

"Novae plantae americanae annis 1778-79 collectae" mss. in Institut de France (via library Delessert) (fide PR). Guerra (DSB) states that Dombey burned his notes and manuscripts.
