### Publications

##### n.1285. A catalogue of the plants growing wild in the environs of London

**Title**
*A catalogue of the plants growing wild in the environs of London*. London 1774. Qu. or Oct. in twos (n.v.)
**Abbreviated title**: *Cat. pl. London*.

**Notes**
*Publ*.: 1774. p. \[1\]-40. – Wrongly attributed to W. Curtis by *Dryander* (1798). Gilmour has shown that the internal evidence does not support this supposition. The authorship remains unsettled.
*Ref*.: BM 1: 407; Jackson p. 251; Kew 1: 664; PR 1998; IDC 5119.
- Gilmour, J. Soc. Bibl. nat. Hist. 2(5): 181-182. 1949.

##### n.1286. Flora londinensis

**Title**
*Flora londinensis*: or plates and descriptions of such plants as grow wild in the environs of London: with their places of growth, and times of flowering; their several names according to Linnaeus and other authors: with a particular description of each plant in Latin and English. To which are added, their several uses in medecine, agriculture, rural oeconomy, and other arts. London (author) \[1775-\]1777-1798. 2 vols. Fol.
**Abbreviated title**: *Fl. londin.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: For a detailed study of this intricate book see Stevenson, Dandy, and Stearn; for a summary see Henrey 595-598. These authors also give references, not repeated here, to previous treatises. The work consisted of 432 (434; see Cardew) plates, each with accompanying text, issued in 72 "numbers" of 6 plates each. Twelve "numbers" constituted a "fascicle, " three fascicles constituted a volume. The plates were num bered in three ways: a) the numbers assigned to them in each fascicle index, b) those in each volume index and c) the numbers engraved on some of them. Since the publication by Stevenson, Dandy, and Stearn is not easily available, the analysis of the contents of the fascicles and numbers is repeated here with kind permission from the Hunt Botanical Library. However, for an enumeration of the names of the plants illustrated on the plates and of their modern equivalents, reference must be made to the Hunt Catalogue (HU 650). The dates given here are those given by Stevenson, Dandy, and Stearn with the exception of those marked with an asterisk, which are the dates of receipt by the University Library at Cambridge. These dates agree all very well with the general scheme as given by Stevenson et al. and fill some gaps in the information. However, the Cambridge University Library records give as the date of receipt of parts 1-23, 22 Jul 1775 and as that of parts 24-46, 9 Nov 1779. This discrepancy is difficult to solve at the moment.

William Curtis (1746-1799) owned and conducted the Magazine from 1789-1799; plates 450-468 were brought out under Thomas Curtis; John Sims took over from vol. 14 onward (although mentioned for the first time only on the titlepage of volume 15) whereas Samuel Curtis was proprietor and owner from 1801-1845. The copyright was transferred from Samuel Curtis to Messrs. Lovell and Reeve who held it until 1920. In 1921 a group of horticulturists, led by H. J. Elwes purchased the copyright which was subsequently transferred to the Royal Horticultural Society. Volume 147 was sponsored by Reginald Cory in order to fill the gap that had occurred on the occasion of the 1920-1922 transfer but due to various difficulties it could come out only after Cory's death.
The anomalous publication date of vol. 163, part 2, was caused by the destruction of the stock of plates and text in the air-raid on London of 29-30 December 1940.
Variant title pages exist of the early volumes caused by the production following the demand.
