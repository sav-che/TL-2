### Author

Catesby, Mark (1683-1749), English traveller and naturalist, in Virginia 1712-1719, Carolina etc. 1722-1726. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Catesby*

#### Herbarium and types

The main Catesby collections are at [[Collection BM|BM]] in the Sloane herbarium, in [[Collection OXF|OXF]] (mainly) in the Sherard herbarium and in [[Collection E|E]], in the Dubois herbarium. For a detailed discussion of the Sloane set and the Linnaean types contained in them, see Dandy. Catesby's own plates were made (according to his own account) in the field and were based on fresh material. Linnaeus founded species and varieties upon some of the plates, and a number of specimens in the Sloane set can be associated with certain of the plates. Sherard acquired an important set of Catesby's plants and in many cases (fide Clokie) these specimens are accompanied by Catesby's own holographic notes.

The same is true of the German translation published in 1755. Plates from this edition were used by J. M. Seligmann in his Sammlung... Vögel, 9 tom., 1746-1776.
