### Author

Buddle, Rev. Adam (*c*. 1660-1715), English botanist, M. A. Cambridge 1685, rector of North Fambridge, Essex. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Buddle* \[standard form in IPNI: *Buddle*\]

#### Herbarium and types

Thirteen volumes (bound in four) and some separate collections in the [[Collection BM|Sloane Herbarium]] (H.S. 114-130), described by Dandy. The herbarium is in excellent preservation, the specimens well chosen, carefully annotated and named: "undoubtedly the most trustworthy and accurately-named... of the period" (Trimen and Dyer, p. 388). The herbarium was used by Dillenius for his third edition of Ray's *Synopsis* (1724) and to some extent also by Hudson for his *Flora anglica* 1762. The plants were collected mainly by Buddie with the help of his friends (note in H.S. 114) "the Revd. Mr Stonestreet, Dr Plukenet, Mr Bobart, Mr Lhuyde, Mr Vernon, Mr Petiver, Dr Richardson, Mr Doody, Mr Dubois, and others." The collections were bequeathed to Sloane but were in Petiver's hands when he died. Sloane put the herbarium at the disposal of Sherard and Dillenius. Dandy cites the following additional contributors (mostly England except when otherwise stated): Airy, Joseph Andrews, John Banister (Virginia), Robert Barker, Jacob Bobart, George Boucher (Minorca?), Samuel Dale, Thomas Dandridge, Samuel Doody, Charles Du Bois (India), Sir Richard Gipps, William Houstoun (Jamaica), Jezreel Jones (Africa), Edward Lhwyd, Rev. Thomas Manningham, Robert Millar, More, James Newton, Rev. William Nicolson, James Petiver (miscellaneous), Leonard Plukenet, Isaac Rand, Richard Richardson, John Robinson, John Scampton, Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (Switzerland), Rev. John Sedgwick, William Sherard, Sir Hans Sloane, Rev. Lewis Stevens, George Stonestreet, James Stuherland, John Thorpe, Sébastien Vaillant (Paris garden), William Vernon, Windsor. – The Buddle herbarium was one of the earliest herbaria containing cryptogams.
