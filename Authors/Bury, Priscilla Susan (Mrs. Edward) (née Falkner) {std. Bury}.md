### Publications

##### n.937. A selection of hexandrian plants

**Title**
*A selection of hexandrian plants*, belonging to the natural orders Amaryllidae and Liliacae, from drawings by Mrs. Edward Bury, engraved by R. Havell.s.l.\[1831-1834\]. Fol.
**Abbreviated title**: *Select, hexandr. pl.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: In ten fascicles, 1831-1834. The 51 plates accompanied by letter press; they are in part aquatints, in part colour printed. — The book with its outsize plates (64 × 48 cm) has been described in glowing terms: "Opus splendidissum... tabulae secundum plantas vivae horti Edinburgensis, eximia, quam Aquatinta vocant, arte pictae" (PR), "... of perfect technique, very decorative and "modern" in feeling..." (DU). Mrs. Bury of Liverpool was the artist, R. Havell (who did the original folio Audubon plates as well) did the engraving and printing. The author of the text is not known. The number of copies printed was small and the book is very rare. In 1973 a book-seller offered a good copy for *£* 1500.—. The Plesch copy sold (1975) at $ 3000.—. The value of the book lies with its artistical and horticultural interest. It is a charming late phenomenon of the late eighteenth century attitude towards nature "... with so many pleasing allurements endowed."
