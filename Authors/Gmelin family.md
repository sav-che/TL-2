### Author

Gmelin family. The genealogy of this family that contributed greatly to Botany is analyzed in \[Moriz Gmelin\], *Stammbaum der Familie Gmelin* 1877 (n.v.). The "botanical" Gmelins essentially begin with Johann Georg Gmelin (1674-1728) who defended a botanical thesis under Rudolf Jakob Camerarius in 1699, married in 1706, and had three "key" children and three "key" grandchildren.

1. Johann Konrad Gmelin (1707-1759) who had 15 children, incl.: \*Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin (1745-1774) (TL-2/1: 958) who traveled in s. Russia with P.S. Pallas and died in Persia; and Christian Gottlieb Gmelin (1749-1809) who had a connection with Goethe.

2. \*Johann Georg Gmelin (1709-1755) (TL-2/1: 956-957) who traveled in Siberia, became Prof. of Bot. and Chemistry in Tübingen, and published *Fl. siber.*... 1747-1769, 4 vols. (TL-2/1, nr. 2047), the last 2 vols. of which were edited by his nephew, \*Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin (see above).

3. \*Philipp Friedrich Gmelin (1721-1768) (TL-2/1: 957-958), also of Tübingen who had the following sons: \*Johann Friedrich Gmelin (1748-1804), (TL-2/1: 955-956), Prof. at Tübingen, then at Göttingen, editor of the 13th (i.e. the last) ed. of *Syst. nat.*... 1788-1793 (TL-2/1, nr. 2043); and \*Carl Christian Gmelin (1762-1837) (TL-2/1: 954-955), author of *Fl. bad.*... 1805-1826, 4 vols. (TL-2/1, nr. 2040).
