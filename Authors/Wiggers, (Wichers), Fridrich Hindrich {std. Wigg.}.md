### Author

Wiggers, \[Wichers\], Fridrich Hindrich (1746-1811), \[Schleswig-\] Holstein physician and botanist; born at Krempe, Holstein (then part of Denmark); studied at the University of Kiel 1774-1780; Dr. med. 1780, 1784; practicing physician at Apenrade (Schleswig) from 1784. 
**Abbreviated name**: *Wigg.*

#### Herbarium and types

Unknown; it is probable that Wigger's *Primitiae* was largely, if not solely, based on observations and collections made by G.H. Weber (see under that author).

#### Eponymy

*Wiggersia* Alefeld (1861).

#### Note

Wiggers was baptized Friderich Hinrich Wichers, but his name was spelled Friderich Hindrich Wiggers in the church registers of his marriage and the baptism of his children. The orthography Wiggers appears also on the title page of his dissertation (see below). For botanical nomenclatural purposes "Wiggers" should be used rather than the historically correct Wichers. The orthography Friedrich Heinrich Wiggers was traced back by Grummann to the church register in Husum in which W.'s death was recorded. The title page of the *Primitiae* has Fridericus Henricus Wiggers; the dedication has Fridericus Henricus Wichers, sic. For original research on this matter see V.J. Grummann (1962).

- (2) We reproduce here Proskauer's analysis (1958) of the reasons to attribute the *Primitiae* indeed to F.H. Wiggers and not to G.H. Weber, the "auctor": "Published in 1780 as a doctoral thesis in the University of Kiel, with J.C. Kerstens listed as the presiding professor on the title page. In the preface Wiggers acknowledged considerable, but by no means total, indebtedness to the writings and lectures of the "Praeceptor" G.H.
Weber, especially as concerns the treatment of the cryptogams. "Nouam quam libellus tradit cryptogamicarum plantarum dispositionem, sed nondum ab omni parte absolutam, praelectionibus celeberrimi WEBERI, hausi".
In 1787 Weber published a supplement to the work, which begins: "Ex quo in *Primitiis florae Holsaticae* vegetabilium vtriusque Ducatus indigenarum brevem adumbrationem exposueram,...", which sentence (fide Christiansen & Christiansen, 1932, p. 7-8; also D. Willi Christiansen in litt.) has led to acceptance of Weber as the author of the original work. Names first published in it have been invested with a remarkable variety of author citations (cf., e.g., in this Journal: Grummann, 1958, p. 55).
Having made a considerable search of the relevant contemporary and later literature, I am led to the following considerations and conclusions. It is well known that many of the earlier theses were more the work of the professor than the candidate, and indeed it was custom to cite them under the name of the professor. The bone of contention in the case under consideration was surely this: on the title of Wiggers' dissertation the name of Professor Kerstens appeared, not that of Weber. (In the library catalogue of the Linnean Society \[Savage, 1925\], conservative in such matters, we still find the main entry of the work sub "Kerstens..., *Praeses*"!). I interprete the introductory sentence of Weber pater (1787) and the citation by Weber fil. and Mohr (1807, p. XXX: "Wiggers, Fr. Henr. (Ge. H. Weber)") as protests to make clear who should have been the "praeses", and find no conflict with Wiggers' statements in his preface, which I accept at face value. I conclude that, unless otherwise stated in the work, a newly proposed name is to be credited to Wiggers alone. This would be so even if such a name indeed initially derived from Weber, as there is no denial that Weber pater consented to such use by Wiggers of certain of his unpublished material. A colleague or professor who freely suggests a name or diagnosis, or writes it on a herbarium label, receives no credit in nomenclature in this world, other than by courtesy of the publishing author. Who would wish to assess the relative degree of authorship of professor and candidate in many dissertations of our present time?" \[J. Proskauer, Taxon 7: 124. 1958\].
