The hand-coloured engraved plates are all by H. C. Andrews. Dunthorne speaks of "etchings coloured by hand, often printed in blue green ink." The text of the first 5 volumes was probably written by John Kennedy, that for vol. 6 by A. Haworth, vol. 7-10 by George Jackson. Originally issued in parts of 3 plates each (parts 1-34) later of 5 plates each. A second "edition" was published in 10 volumes in 1816, London (T. Cope, for author); actually this is a re-issue with a newly printed title page in vol. 1 (NY). – The volumes are made up by the plates as cited, preceded by the engr. t.p., and followed by indexes and errata (1: \[1\] ind.; 2-4: \[1\] ind., \[1 err.\]; 5: id. plus \[1\] ind. vols. 1-5; 6-9 as 2-4; 10, id. plus \[1\] index vols. 6-10).
