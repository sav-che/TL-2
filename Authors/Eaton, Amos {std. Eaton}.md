### Publications

##### n.1614. A manual of botany

**Title**
*A manual of botany* for the northern states. Comprising generic descriptions of all phenogamous and cryptogamous plants to the North of Virginia, hitherto described; with references to the natural orders of Linnaeus and Jussieu. Each genus is further illustrated by short descriptions of its most common species. By the members of the botanical class in Williams' College (Mass.). From a manuscript system, compiled by the author of Richard's botanical dictionary, Albany (Websters and Skinners) 1817. Duod. (in sixes)
**Abbreviated title**: *Man. bot.*

**Notes**
*Publ*.: the titles of the eight editions vary; for detailed transcriptions and for collations (eds. 1-7) see Margadant (MD). The eighth edition, by Eaton and Wright, is entitled *North American Botany*. All except the first bear the author's name. Merrill and Reeder list the new names of phanerogams in all editions. They also provide a key (p. 39) to Eaton's sometimes very cryptic abbreviations of names of authors and of localities.
