**Notes**
*Ed. 1*: 10 Mar 1756, map, \[i\*-iii\*\], \[i\]-viii, \[2, catal. auth.), \[1\]-503, *pl. 1-49*, uncoloured copper engr. *Copy*: MICH. – P. Browne wrote to Linnaeus on 11 Mar 1756 (Hulth 1918): "Yesterday it was at length published, and I sent a copy inscribed with your name to the booksellers..." (translation H. W. Rickett). The Monthly Review (15: 30-43. Jul 1756, 15: 333-344. Oct 1756) mentions publication of the first edition in three parts; the Critical Rev. of Jun 1756 (165): 389-409. Jun 1756) also mentions three parts. According to present evidence these three parts must have come out almost simultaneously. New generic names mostly validly published because monotypic or because of special (typographically distinct) descriptions under the first species. For binomials see ed. 2, London 1789. add. index 1; and also the index to Richter's Codex (TL1: 1882) which often cites the first binomials given to Browne's species. The plates are by G. D. Ehret (1708-1770).
*Ed. 2*: 1789, p. \[i\*-iv\*\], map, \[i\]-viii, 1-503, *pl. 1-49*, four additional indexes \[1-46\], catal. auth. \[47-48\]. London (B. White and Son) 1789. Fol. *Copy*: NY. Title: "The civil... \[end of II:\] physic. By Patrick Browne, M.D. Illustrated with forty-nine copper-plates in which the most curious productions are represented of their natural sizes, and delineated immediately from the objects, by George Dionysius Ehret. There are now added complete Linnaean indexes, and a large and accurate map of the island."
The plates of the second edition were re-engraved and are reversed with the Linnaean binomials added.
