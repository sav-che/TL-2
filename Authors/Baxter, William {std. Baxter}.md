As soon as a volume was completed, this was also issued somewhat later as a whole, with a separate title-page and usually with a dated dedication; this issue of completed sets of volumes was regarded as the "second edition." The sixth volume (dedication dated 15 Mai 1843) has extensive indexes. The run of the paperbacked parts is considered the "first edition," completed sets of volumes are inscribed second edition on the title-page of the first volume. A reprint (third "edition") was issued in 1856 (text and plates same as in orig.). The 509 coloured copper engravings (accompanied by letter press) are mainly by W. A. Delamotte, C. Mathews and Isaac Russell. The originals are in the Lindley library of the Royal Horticultural Society, London.
Second issue ("edition") (see above):
