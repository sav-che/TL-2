### Author

Oldenland, Henrik Bernard (x-1699), Danish physician and botanist; studied under Paul Hermann at Leiden and went to the Cape around 1695; superintendent of the Dutch East Indian Company's Garden at Cape Town. 
**Abbreviated name**: *==Name in the standard form is not specified==.*

#### Herbarium and types

Oldenland's herbarium seems to have consisted originally of 13 or 14 folio volumes of plants accompanied by descriptions. The herbarium was evidently disposed of in parts by Oldenland's widow. The most important part came ultimately in the hands of the Burman family and was given on loan to Linnaeus by Nicolaus Laurens Burman. Linnaeus based many of his *Plantae rariores africanae*(1760) on these plants. This part of the Oldenland collections is now at [[Collection G|G]]. Another part was acquired by Sir Hans Sloane and is now at [[Collection BM|BM]]. Linnaeus received duplicates from Burman, hence the presence of some Oldenland specimens in [[Collection LINN|LINN]]. The Thunberg herbarium (at [[Collection UPS|UPS]]) also contains Oldenland specimens from the Cape. It is probable that Thunberg received these from the Burmans. Some Oldenland material is also at [[Collection B|B]]-WIL and [[Collection OXF|OXF]].
