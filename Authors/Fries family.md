### Author

Fries family. As there is much confusion about this Swedish family that produced so many well known botanists, we thought it wise to incorporate here a small chapter on their "botanical" genealogy. This is useful as several members of this family received the same given names and often published using only part of their names. A more complete genealogy can be found at Elias Fries Ättlingar (an electronic resource).

#### Notes

1st generation: The first and best known botanist in the Fries family was Elias Magnus Fries (1794-1878) (better known as Elias Fries). Elias Fries had eight children among which three sons continued his interest in botany, viz. (1) Theodor \[Thore\] M\[agnus\]. Fries (1832-1913); (2) Elias Petrus Fries (1834-1858); and (3) Oscar \[Oskar\] Robert Fries (1840-1908) (a.k.a. Robert Fries, which often causes confusion with Robert E. Fries of the next generation).

2nd generation: The eldest son of Elias Fries, Theodor M. Fries (1832-1913), also had three sons interested in botany, viz. (1) Klas Robert Elias Fries (1876-1966) (better known as Robert E. Fries); (2) Thoralf Gustaf Elias Fries (1882-1963) (better known as Thoralf Fries, and almost unknown to botany); and (3) Thore Christian Elias Fries (1886-1930) (a.k.a. Thore Fries). The wife of Thore Fries, Fennia Maria Fries (née Rosberg) (1897-1987), painted and collected plants.

The second son of Elias Fries, Elias Petrus Fries (1834-1858), died at only 24 years of age without issue.

The third son of Elias Fries, Johan Otto Fries (1838-1931), was a surveyor and did not contribute to botany.

The fourth son of Elias Fries, Oscar Robert Fries (1840-1908), had nine children of which one son, Elias Theodor (Thore) Fries (1875-1951), made his living as a physician but also was active in botany.

3rd generation: Klas Robert Elias Fries (1867-1966), the second son of Theodor M. Fries (1832-1913), had one son, Carl Magnus Elias Fries (1917-1987) (a.k.a. Magnus Fries), who was a docent in botany at Uppsala Univ.

Thoralf Gustaf Elias Fries (1882-1963), the seventh child of Theodor M. Fries (1832-1913), had one son, Nils Thorsten Elias Fries (1912-1994) (a.k.a. Nils Fries), who was a prof. of fungal physiology at Uppsala Univ.

The following entries will treat members of the Fries family in alphabetic order, using their full given names, thus e.g. Rob. E. Fries will be alphabetized as (Klas) Robert Elias Fries, etc.
