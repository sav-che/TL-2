TL-2 vault was designed primarily for offline use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a free open-source note-taking software. Users of Obsidian can set up this vault locally on their own computers (it will look almost exactly as the website) and enjoy richer tools of a standalone Obsidian application. Importing TL-2 vault is easy; instructions and downloads can be found at GitHub repository: https://github.com/sav-che/TL-2.
