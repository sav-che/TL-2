# TL-2 vault for Obsidian

This is a repository for digital version of **Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications and collections with dates, commentaries and types, ed. 2** (usually abbreviated **TL-2**). It is presented as a folder-based markdown-formatted "vault" for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and can be either viewed online (https://tl2.io) or used offline from your own Obsidian installation.

## Offline setup 

1. Install Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/download.
2. Download TL-2 vault (any of TL-2_\* archives in https://github.com/sav-che/TL-2/releases/latest) and extract it in a preferred location.
3. Open Obsidian. On the first launch it will ask for action – select "Open folder as vault" and navigate to the folder you specified above. If you already have some vault opened, click on small "Open another vault" button in bottom left corner, as in the screenshot below. After that the setup is done.

## Fonts

The fonts cannot be included in the vault. If you want to see the same fonts as in *tl2.io*, please install them on your system:

- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4

- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro    

## Tips

- To quickly search through page names (= author names), first type `file:` in the search bar. To do so for publication numbers and titles, type `section:`.

- To use regular expressions in the search, put your query between slashes, e.g. `/Charko[vw]/`

- Othe useful search options are explained here: https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search

- All official help pages: https://help.obsidian.md/.

- Note that Obsidian have two modes: editing and viewing, toggled with a button on upper right. Usually you would want to keep it in reading view.

- If you want to edit the content frequently, you might want to switch default mode to "editing" in Settings → Editor → Default view for new tabs.
